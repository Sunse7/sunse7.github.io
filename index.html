      <h2>Some backstory</h2>
      <p>This is a game about a unicorn called Charlie.<br>
         One day when Charlie was out for a stroll in the woods <br>
         he noticed something strange in the sky. <br>
         Everything went quiet. <br>
         Dark clouds started forming and he could hear thunder rumbling. <br>
         The bright sunny forest had now become dark and gloomy. <br>
         Even the trees felt different, hauntingly.
         Where did all the animals go? <br>
         Charlie saw no signs of them... <br>
         He got an eerie feeling <br>
         It felt almost like he was beeing watched...
